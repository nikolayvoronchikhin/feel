# feel

feel is a simple weather-status watchface. Useful for active atheletes, meteorologists, weather nerds, and anyone who wants to know why the weather has 'felt' a certain way.

The temperature is shown on top, and the dew-point is shown at the bottom. As of now, the watchface will update every 30 min. Future versions may support user-configured update time-intervals.

All of the weather data is in the metric system. To keep things simple, the temperature and dew-point values will be in metric units.

Simple scale.

- 0C: cold
- 10C: cool
- 20C: comfortable
- 30C: warm
- 40C: hot
